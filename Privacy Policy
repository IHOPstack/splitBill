I take privacy very seriously.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any inadvertant security vulnerability, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email beckwithdevin@yahoo.com, and I will fix it/help you.
